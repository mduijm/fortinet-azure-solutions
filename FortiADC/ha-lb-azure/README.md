# FortiADC HA with Microsoft Standard Loadbalancer




## Introduction

More and more enterprises are turning to Microsoft Azure to extend or replace internal data centers and take advantage of the elasticity of the public cloud. While Azure secures the infrastructure, you are responsible for protecting the resources you put in it. As workloads are being moved from local data centers connectivity and security are key elements to take into account. The FortiADC family of application delivery controllers (ADC) optimizes the availability, user experience, performance and scalability of enterprise application delivery.

An ADC is like an advanced server load balancer. An ADC routes traffic to available destination servers based on health checks and load-balancing algorithms; full-featured ADC like FortiADC also improve application performance by assuming some of the server task load. Server tasks that can be handled by the FortiADC appliance include SSL encryption/decryption, WAF protection, Gzip compression, and routing processes, such as NAT.

### Features

FortiADC uses Layer 4 and Layer 7 session information to enable an ADC policy and management framework for:

Server load balancing
Link load balancing
Global load balancing
Security
The FortiADC D-series family includes physical appliances and virtual appliances.

### Azure CLI
To fast track the deployment, use the Azure Cloud Shell. The Azure Cloud Shell is an in-browser CLI that contains Terraform and other tools for deployment into Microsoft Azure. It is accessible via the Azure Portal or directly at [https://shell.azure.com/](https://shell.azure.com). You can copy and paste the below one-liner to get started with your deployment.

`cd ~/clouddrive/ && wget -qO- https://github.com/jvhoof/fortinet-azure-solutions/archive/main.tar.gz | tar zxf - && cd ~/clouddrive/fortinet-azure-solutions-main/FortiGate/A-Single-VM/ && ./deploy.sh`

After deployment, you will be shown the IP addresses of all deployed components. This information is also stored in the output directory in the 'summary.out' file. You can access both management GUI's using the public management IP addresses using HTTPS on port 443.

## Requirements and limitations

The Azure ARM template deployment deploys different resources and is required to have the access rights and quota in your Microsoft Azure subscription to deploy the resources.

### Licenses

- The template will deploy Standard F2s VMs for this architecture. Other VM instances are supported as well with a minimum of 2 NICs. A list can be found [here](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/6.2.0/azure-cookbook/562841/instance-type-support)
- Licenses for Fortigate
  - BYOL: A demo license can be made available via your Fortinet partner or on our website. These can be injected during deployment or added after deployment.
  - PAYG or OnDemand: These licenses are automatically generated during the deployment of the FortiGate systems.

### Fabric Connector
The FortiGate-VM uses [Managed Identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/) for the SDN Fabric Connector. A SDN Fabric Connector is created automatically during deployment. After deployment, it is required apply the 'Reader' role to the Azure Subscription you want to resolve Azure Resources from. More information can be found on the [Fortinet Documentation Libary](https://docs.fortinet.com/vm/azure/fortigate/6.4/azure-cookbook/6.4.0/236610/creating-a-fabric-connector-using-a-managed-identity).

## Support
Fortinet-provided scripts in this and other GitHub projects do not fall under the regular Fortinet technical support scope and are not supported by FortiCare Support Services.
